# How to Contribute

The Rash project in under [The GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE). We accept contributions
via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some of the conventions related to
development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other
resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.

## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a
Signed-off-by line to commit messages. For example:

```text
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

Git even has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your
commit message:

```shell
git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

If you have already made a commit and forgot to include the sign-off, you can amend your last commit
to add the sign-off with the following command, which can then be force pushed.

```shell
git commit --amend -s
```

We use a [DCO bot](https://github.com/apps/dco) to enforce the DCO on each pull
request and branch commits.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
1. Read the [install](INSTALL.md) for build and test instructions
1. Play with the project, submit bugs, submit patches!

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

1. Create a branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).
1. Make your changes and arrange them in readable commits.
1. Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
1. Push your changes to the branch in your fork of the repository.
1. Make sure all tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
1. Submit a pull request to the original repository.

## Coding Style

Rash projects are written in Rust and follows a functional style trying to keep code simple.

## Comments

Comments should be added to all new methods and structures as is appropriate for the coding
language. Additionally, if an existing method or structure is modified sufficiently, comments should
be created if they do not yet exist and updated if they do.

The goal of comments is to make the code more readable and grokkable by future developers. Once you
have made your code as understandable as possible, add comments to make sure future developers can
understand (A) what this piece of code's responsibility is within Rash's architecture and (B) why it
was written as it was.

The below blog entry explains more the why's and how's of this guideline.

## Commit Messages

We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer two
questions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the what and
the body of the commit should describe the why.

```text
ceph: update MON to use rocksdb

this enables us to remove leveldb from the codebase.
```

The format can be described more formally as follows:

```text
<area>: <what changed>
<BLANK LINE>
<why this change was made>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
{% if issue related %}
Resolves: #{issue.id}
{%- endif %}
```

You can find what values area could take see
[rash/.commitlintrc.json](https://github.com/rash-sh/rash-sh.github.io/blob/master/.commitlintrc.json).

The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the
second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters.
This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various
git tools.

**Important!** Any submitted pull request needs to have commit messages validated according
to that specification. To avoid nasty surprises, we set up a `commit-msg` hook that validates
your commit message before the commit actually takes place.

You need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for this hook to work.
If you're working on Linux, make sure you can run it with non-root permissions! More info
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

Finally, keep in mind that you need to set up the hooks before you commit for the first time.
It's really easy, as `cargo-husky` takes care of the whole thing. You just need to ensure you
run `cargo test` at least once before committing. If the hooks changed at some point in the repo,
remove any `target` directory and run `cargo test` again.
